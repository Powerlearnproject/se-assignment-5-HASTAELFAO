9. Debugging in VS Code:
   - Outline the steps to set up and start debugging a simple program in VS Code. What are some key debugging features available in VS Code?
   - Setting Up and Starting Debugging in VS Code
Install Required Extensions:

Ensure you have the appropriate extensions installed for the programming language you're using. For example, if you're debugging JavaScript, you might need the Debugger for Chrome extension.
Open Your Project:

Open your project folder in VS Code.
Create a Launch Configuration:

VS Code uses launch configurations to set up debugging sessions. You can create a launch configuration manually or use a predefined template.
Manual Configuration:
Go to the Run view by clicking on the debug icon in the Activity Bar on the side (or use the shortcut Ctrl+Shift+D).
Click on the gear icon to create a launch.json file.
Choose the environment or template that matches your project (e.g., Node.js, Chrome, Python).
Using a Template:
If your project supports it, VS Code may offer to generate a basic launch.json for you when you start debugging for the first time.
Set Breakpoints:

Navigate to the file where you want to set breakpoints (places in your code where you want the debugger to pause execution).
Click in the left-hand gutter next to the line number where you want to set a breakpoint. A red dot should appear.
Start Debugging:

Once you have your launch configuration set up and breakpoints placed:
Click the green play button in the Run view to start debugging (or use the F5 key).
Alternatively, you can run the Start Debugging command from the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+D and then Enter).
Interact with the Debugger:

When the debugger hits a breakpoint, VS Code will pause execution at that point in your code.
Use the controls in the Debug Console or Variables view to inspect variables, step through code line by line, and execute specific functions.
Key Debugging Features in VS Code
Breakpoints:

Set breakpoints to pause execution at specific lines of code for inspection.
Watch Expressions:

Monitor variables or expressions in real-time as you step through your code.
Call Stack:

View the call stack to understand the path that led to the current point in your code.
Debug Console:

Interact with your running code, execute commands, and evaluate expressions directly in the debug console.
Variable Inspection:

Easily inspect the current state of variables and their values during debugging.
Step Through Code:

Use commands like step over (F10), step into (F11), and step out (Shift+F11) to navigate through your code execution.
Conditional Breakpoints:

Set breakpoints that only trigger when specific conditions are met, enhancing flexibility in debugging.
Debugging Hotkeys:

VS Code provides keyboard shortcuts for common debugging actions, making it quick to navigate and control the debugging process.

10. Using Source Control:
    - How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.
    - Initializing a Repository
Open Your Project:

Open the folder or workspace of your project in VS Code.
Initialize Git Repository:

Open the Source Control view by clicking on the source control icon in the Activity Bar on the side (or use the shortcut Ctrl+Shift+G).
Click on the Initialize Repository button (it looks like a folder with a plus sign) or use the command Git: Initialize Repository.
Confirm Repository Initialization:

Choose the root folder of your project to initialize Git.
VS Code will create a hidden .git folder in your project directory, indicating that Git version control is now active for that project.
Making Commits
Stage Changes:

In the Source Control view, you'll see a list of files that have been modified since the last commit.
Click on the + icon next to each file you want to stage for the commit. This prepares them to be included in the next commit.
Commit Changes:

Enter a commit message that briefly describes the changes you're committing.
Press Ctrl+Enter or click the check mark âœ“ to commit the changes.
Pushing Changes to GitHub
Link Your Repository to GitHub:

If you haven't already, create a repository on GitHub where you want to push your local changes.
Copy the HTTPS or SSH URL of your GitHub repository.
Add Remote Repository:

In VS Code, open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and type Git: Add Remote.
Paste the URL of your GitHub repository when prompted and give it a name (e.g., origin).
Push Commits to GitHub:

After committing your changes locally, open the Source Control view.
Click on the ... (three dots) menu and select Push.
VS Code will ask you to choose the branch you want to push (typically main or master).
Confirm by clicking OK or Push.
Enter GitHub Credentials (if prompted):

If this is your first time pushing to GitHub from VS Code, you may need to enter your GitHub username and password or use a personal access token for authentication.
Verify Changes on GitHub:

Once the push is complete, visit your GitHub repository in a web browser to verify that your changes have been successfully pushed.

 Submission Guidelines:
- Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
- Provide screenshots or step-by-step instructions where applicable.
- Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
- Submit your completed assignment by 1st July
